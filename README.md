# Malaria-Detection-Using-Blood-Cell-Images
Our project aims to enhance malaria diagnosis in Pakistan using deep learning on blood smear images. By automating detection with CNNs like VGG16, leveraging transfer learning, and rigorous data preprocessing, we aim to improve accuracy and speed of diagnosis in resource-limited settings,potentially reducing malaria-related morbidity and mortality.
